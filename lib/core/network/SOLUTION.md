# API Client Refactoring Solution

## Problem
The codebase had multiple API client implementations across different features, leading to code duplication, inconsistent error handling, and maintenance challenges.

## Solution
We've implemented a centralized API client structure that provides:

1. **Single API Client**: A unified `ApiClient` class in `lib/core/network/api_client.dart`
2. **Centralized Endpoints**: All API endpoints defined in `lib/core/network/api_endpoints.dart`
3. **Consistent Response Format**: A standardized `ApiResponse` class
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy code continues to work through compatibility layers

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Components
- **ApiClient**: Singleton class with methods for GET/POST requests
- **ApiEndpoints**: Static class with all API endpoint URLs
- **ApiResponse**: Unified response format

### 2. Service Layer Updates
- **AuthService**: Updated to use the centralized client
- **AgreementService**: Updated to use the centralized client

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- **ApiClientWithAuth**: Updated to use the new centralized client internally

### 4. Dependency Injection
- Updated to register the new centralized ApiClient

## Benefits
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common HTTP logic is in one place
- **Consistent Error Handling**: All API calls use the same error handling approach
- **Easier Maintenance**: Adding or changing endpoints only requires changes in one file
- **Better Testability**: The API layer can be easily mocked for testing

## Future Improvements
- Add more HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Implement request/response logging for debugging
- Add request caching for improved performance
- Add request retries for network failures
